Dear Madam/Sir,

**Ref: **

Dear Madam/Sir,

I want to play an active role in systematising digital innovation adoption in Integrated Gas and Upstream, focused on commerciality and operation strategy. In my career it’s been often required that I engage and influence the decisions of senior stakeholders, assurance teams, academia and national agencies, while supporting negotiations and agreeing on techno-economic excellence. I trust those are skills that would benefit the DD&I team.

There are two specific competencies I would like to highlight in this letter:

- **Fostering cooperation:** I am an integrative professional by nature. In my years in Shell I have a track record of collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, leveraging subject matter expertise, R&D professionals, IT architecture, support teams and senior stakeholders. For this reason, (successfully) finished projects were transitioned to support, releasing my team’s time to take part in new ideas.
- **Business acumen:** With a degree in Petroleum Engineering, and the direct experience in businesses roles in Upstream and Downstream for 8 years, before my consultancy-focused work of the last years, I have strong appreciation for the industry's core activities. I foster engagement with decision makers, making sure their requirements are addressed in schedule, performance and cost, while also making the delivery team accountable.

I am a hard-working, curious and creative engineer who always seeks analytical and result oriented solutions to problems.
Throughout my career I have fostered collaborative relationships and was fortunate to assimilate valuable professional lessons.
I also believe few of my achievements would be possible without close integration and extensive network with other disciplines in the industry.

Thank you for your time in considering this application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Estêvão Alvarenga CEng MIET

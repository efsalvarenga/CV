I am a petroleum engineer specialised in computational sciences for building and translating analytics into engineering language. I coordinate a team of 7 analysts and data scientists, delivering petroleum analytics projects for exploration, new business development, subsurface and wells.

I've been in the Oil & Energy industry for 12 years and am passionate about capturing in-depth commercial awareness across E&P, refining, utilities and new energies. My engineering background is supported by further academic education in operational research and management sciences.

Out of the office I enjoy spending time with my family, powerlifting, trekking and cycling.



- I am skilful in slicing and communicating complex problems into modularised sub-components
- decision scientist
- designing analytics solutions and supporting colleagues translate mathematics into engineering and management language

Dear Madam/Sir,

**Ref: Application for the Technology Advisor role**

I would like to be part of the PTX/D Digital Innovation team as the Technology Advisor.
This motivation letter is accompanied by my CV with more detailed description of my professional experience.

I am a Chartered Engineer (UK's Institution of Engineering and Technology), passionate about driving technology adoption in the oil & energy industry.
I have contributed to the delivery of several multi-million projects for oil & gas production, refining and transportation, utilities and new energies.
My extensive experience within our industry, including deep understanding of several of its businesses, is supported by further academic education on operational research and management sciences.
My specific expertise includes asset management, project scoping & valuation, data science (operational research, mathematical modelling & machine learning), leadership and communication.

The Digital Innovation team would fit both my career aspirations and the history I’ve built so far.
I want to play an active role in systematising sustainable digital innovation adoption within Shell, focused on business requirements and the group strategy.
In my career it’s been often required that I engage and influence the decisions of senior stakeholders (executives and directors), assurance teams, academia and Brazil’s national oil agency, while supporting negotiations and agreeing on techno-economic excellence.
I trust those are skills that would benefit the team.

There are two specific competencies I would like to highlight in this letter:
- **Business acumen:**
For the last four years I’ve performed in consultancy-oriented environments.
Before Shell, as a Senior Data Scientist for WRc, my attributions included writing project proposals and leveraging internal expertise in new business models.
After that, inside Shell, I have pivoted the ways of working of my own team, where I implemented the concept of fully funded projects.
This required engaging with Shell businesses and making sure their requirements were addressed in schedule, performance and cost, while also making the team more accountable for their deliveries.
- **Integration:**
I am an integrative professional by nature.
In my years in Shell IT I have a track record of collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, leveraging subject matter expertise, R&D professionals, IT architecture, support teams and senior stakeholders.
For this reason, (successfully) finished projects were transitioned to support, releasing my team’s time to take part in new ideas.

I am a hard-working, curious and creative engineer who always seeks analytical and result oriented solutions to problems.
Throughout my career I have fostered collaborative relationships and was fortunate to assimilate valuable professional lessons.
I understand the importance of providing high quality service to customers and correctly understanding their needs, while working efficiently.
I also believe few of my achievements would be possible without close integration and extensive network with other disciplines in the industry.

Thank you for your time in considering this application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Estêvão Alvarenga CEng MIET

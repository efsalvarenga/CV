Dear Madam/Sir,

Ref: Application for the Opportunity Evaluation Manager role

I would like to be part of the PTX Innovation Excellence team as the Opportunity Evaluation Manager.
This motivation letter is accompanied by my CV with more detailed description of my professional experience.

I am a Chartered Engineer (UK's Institution of Engineering and Technology), passionate about driving technology adoption in the oil & energy industry.
I have contributed to the delivery of several multi-million projects for oil & gas production, refining and transportation, utilities and new energies.
My extensive experience within our industry, including deep understanding of several of its businesses, is supported by further academic education on operational research and management sciences.
My specific expertise includes asset management, project scoping & valuation, data science (operational research, mathematical modelling & machine learning), leadership and communication.

The Innovation Excellence team would fit both my career aspirations and the history I’ve built so far.
I want to play an active role in systematising sustainable innovation adoption within Shell, focused on business requirements and the group strategy.
In my career it’s been often required that I engage and influence the decisions of senior stakeholders (executives and directors), assurance teams, academia and Brazil’s national oil agency, while supporting negotiations and agreeing on techno-economic excellence.
I trust those are skills that would benefit the team.

There are two specific competencies I would like to highlight in this letter:

Business acumen:
For the last four years I’ve performed in consultancy-oriented environments.
Before Shell, as a Senior Data Scientist for WRc, my attributions included writing project proposals and leveraging internal expertise in new business models.
After that, inside Shell, I have pivoted the ways of working of my own team, where I implemented the concept of fully funded projects.
This required engaging with Shell businesses and making sure their requirements were addressed in schedule, performance and cost, while also making the team more accountable for their deliveries.

Systems thinking:
An important part of my training as an operational researcher is systems methodologies.
I have formally utilised systems thinking in several applications in my career, one of them being the design of centrally managed inventories for 11 refineries in Brazil.
I have implemented a technique called Soft Systems Methodology for delineating sub-systems, actors, processes and interfaces.
The project was finally implemented and savings in the order of 25% were achieved.

I am a hard-working, curious and creative engineer who always seeks analytical and result oriented solutions to problems.
Throughout my career I have fostered collaborative relationships and was fortunate to assimilate valuable professional lessons.
I understand the importance of providing high quality service to customers and correctly understanding their needs, while working efficiently.
I also believe few of my achievements would be possible without close integration and extensive network with other disciplines in the industry.

Thank you for your time in considering this application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Estêvão Alvarenga CEng MIET

Dear Madam/Sir,

**Ref: Application for the Scientist Quantitative Decision Models role**

I would like to be part of the TNO team in the afore mentioned role.
This motivation letter is accompanied by my CV with more detailed description of my professional experience.

I am a Chartered Engineer (UK's Institution of Engineering and Technology), passionate about driving technology adoption.
I have contributed to the delivery of several multi-million projects for oil & gas, supply chain and utilities.
My extensive experience within highly technical industries is supported by further academic education on operational research and management sciences.
My specific expertise includes asset management, project scoping & valuation, data science (operational research, mathematical modelling & machine learning), leadership and communication.

The TNO team would fit both my career aspirations and the history I’ve built so far.
I want to play an active role in systematising sustainable quantitative innovation adoption in the energy industry, focused on technology maturation and operation strategy.
In my career it’s been often required that I engage and influence the decisions of senior stakeholders (executives and directors), assurance teams, academia and national agencies, while supporting negotiations and agreeing on techno-economic excellence.
I trust those are skills that would benefit the team.

There are two specific competencies I would like to highlight in this letter:
- **Integration:**
I am an integrative professional by nature.
In my years in Shell IT I have a track record of collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, leveraging subject matter expertise, R&D professionals, IT architecture, support teams and senior stakeholders.
For this reason, (successfully) finished projects were transitioned to support, releasing my team’s time to take part in new ideas.
- **Systems thinking:**
An important part of my training as an operational researcher is systems methodologies. I have formally utilised systems thinking in several applications in my career, one of them being the design of centrally managed inventories for 11 refineries in Brazil. I have implemented a technique called Soft Systems Methodology for delineating sub-systems, actors, processes and interfaces. The project was finally implemented and savings in the order of 25% were achieved.

I am a hard-working, curious and creative engineer who always seeks analytical and result oriented solutions to problems.
Throughout my career I have fostered collaborative relationships and was fortunate to assimilate valuable professional lessons.
I understand the importance of providing high quality service to customers and correctly understanding their needs, while working efficiently.
I also believe few of my achievements would be possible without close integration and extensive network with other disciplines in the industry.

Thank you for your time in considering this application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Estêvão Alvarenga CEng MIET

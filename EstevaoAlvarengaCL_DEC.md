Dear Madam/Sir,

**Ref: Decision Science AI Mgr**

I would like to be part of the GM Data & AI Leadership Team in the afore mentioned role. I understand this role will fit both my career aspirations and the experiences I've built so far.

The Decision Science AI role has a specific challenge to still catch-up in productisation and architecture alignment, as compared to other AI teams in our organisation. This is also due to our main vendors not being cloud-first, which makes integration with preferred architecture approaches in Shell difficult. The exception is the strong consultancy scope the team has, which does not depend on these technologies. However, any approach to productise findings would still face challenges. In this role, I would leverage the strong business relationships the teams currently possess, and leverage Shell's weight to bring these requirements to our vendors, making sure Shell can influence the technology direction of industrial decision science intelligence. My network can be leveraged to make sure integration in Shell systems is done swiftly within the different IDT organisations.

Within the teams, I would also prioritise business focus, with the innovation lens, leveraging my background on operational research and industrial engineering, including several business relevant to Shell such as Upstream, Downstream and technology projects. Having worked for 5 years in the Refining business, and divided my last 10 years in upstream and low carbon innovation, I believe I bring significant background on the subject matter of my stakeholders. In my career it’s been often required that I engage and influence the decisions of senior stakeholders, assurance teams, academia and vendors, while supporting negotiations and agreeing on techno-economic excellence. I trust those are skills that would benefit the team.

I am a hard-working, curious and creative engineer who always seeks analytical and result oriented solutions to problems. Throughout my career I have fostered collaborative relationships and was fortunate to assimilate valuable professional lessons. I understand the importance of providing high quality service to customers and correctly understanding their needs, while working efficiently. I also believe few of my achievements would be possible without close integration and extensive network with other disciplines in the industry.

Thank you for your time in considering this application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Estêvão Alvarenga CEng MIET

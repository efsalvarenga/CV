I was the team focal point for wells, reservoir and facilities management, delivering data science and operational research projects for deep water and unconventional oil fields.
Responsible for the team's technical leadership and for maintaining a healthy funnel of work, I have brought in $56m worth of new projects in 2019.
- Delivered 2019's #1 & #2 projects for Unconventionals Technology, with combined estimated NPV of $24m: the Early Productivity Index Calculator (EPIC) and Production Optimisation & Surveillance Tool (POST)
  - These tools productised scientific programming approaches for early assessment of well productivity, driven by new technology conceived by academia and industry research
  - By the end of the year I had upskilled and handed over the project to a junior analyst, while maintaining a technical advisory role.
- Conceived and delivered the Brazil Advanced Data Analytics (BRADA) programme in areas such as reservoir engineering, wells integrity surveillance and contracts / procurement, with an estimated NPV of $20m
- Leveraged the [collaboration between different teams](https://headlinesuk.foleon.com/shell-ai/shellai2019report/upstream-analytics/) within Shell, such as asset teams, technology, development, IT and external research institutes
- Projects where I led the digital workstream were nominated for 5 awards - EPIC was shortlisted for the Global Development Awards and later won the PTX/E VP award in the second half of 2019
- Recognised with a Special Recognition Award for the year 2019

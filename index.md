__Advanced Analytics Technical Lead__ | Shell Information Data & Analytics -
_The Hague, NL (Mar 2020 - Jul 2021)_

Part of the R&D Math Computational & Data Science discipline and currently **leading a team of 6 analysts and data scientists**. My team is focused on maturing proof of concepts into analytics and data science products, with appropriate governance and security, through Agile software development and DevOps methodologies.
Our multi-disciplinary portfolio includes:
  - Delivering a cross-business analytics tool for a large gas export system, **which processes and augments data from hundreds of wells** sharing an installed pipeline capacity of 40mln cubic meters per day (valuated at $20m).
  - Building **a cutting edge surrogate modelling web application** for uncertainty and design choices evaluation based on computer simulations (valuated at $100m), leveraging machine learning, automated testing and cloud technologies.
  - BalloBot, a text analytics solution that **leverages the Shell.ai platform** and delivers contracts & procurement insights to the business (winner of the Shell.ai _Platform Champion_ award).
  - Technically advising with focus on **phased productisation for two Shell R&D contracts in Brazil**, facilitating industry and academia engagements in a technical level, supporting innovative technology adoption.
  - Designing a **data platform for asset operations**, leveraging global data systems, unstructured local data, cloud storage and computation for agile productisation of analytics concepts


__Advanced Analytics / Reservoir Engineer__ | Shell Information Data & Analytics -

I was the team focal point for asset management, delivering data science and operational research projects for deep water and unconventional fields.
Strategically, I have influenced and refocused the team towards high business value projects, coaching team members in principles such as detailed scoping, valuation and prioritisation frameworks.
I have brought in $56m worth of new projects in 2019.
- Delivered **2019's #1 & #2 technologies for Unconventionals**, with combined estimated value of $24m: the Early Productivity Index Calculator (EPIC) and Production Optimisation & Surveillance Tool (POST). With these tools we productised scientific programming approaches for early assessment of well productivity, driven by new technology conceived by academia and industry research.
- **Conceived and delivered the Brazil Advanced Data Analytics (BRADA) programme** prototyping ideas in areas such as subsurface engineering, asset integrity surveillance and contracts & procurement, with an estimated value of $100m+.
- **Leveraged the collaboration between different teams** within Shell, such as subject matter experts, operations, research & technology, software engineering and external institutes.

## Professional Experience

__Advanced Analytics - Technical Leader__ | Shell Information Data & Analytics -
_The Hague, NL (Mar 2020 - Present)_

Currently **leading a team of 6 analysts and data scientists**, developing advanced analytics projects for upstream, integrated gas, renewables and energy solutions.
Our current strategy focuses on maturing proof of concepts into analytics and data science products, with appropriate governance and security.
Our multi-disciplinary portfolio includes:
  - Integrated traditional reservoir engineering approaches with analytics and computational mathematics for the BC-10 waterflood optimisation study.
  - Supporting the AutoSum team: building **[cutting edge surrogate modelling applications](https://rconnect.selfservice.shell.ai/AutoSum/)** for uncertainty and design choices evaluation (valuated at $100m).
  - BalloBot, a text analytics solution that **leverages the Shell.ai platform** and delivers C&P insights to the business (winner of the Shell.ai _Platform Champion_ award).


__Advanced Analytics Analyst - WRFM__ | Shell Information Data & Analytics -
_The Hague, NL (Sep 2018 - Feb 2020)_

I was the team focal point for wells, reservoir and facilities management (WRFM), delivering data science and operational research projects for deep water and unconventional oil fields.
Strategically, I have influenced the team to systematically refocus toward high business value projects, coaching team members in principles such as detailed scoping, valuation and prioritisation frameworks.
I have brought in $56m worth of new projects in 2019.
- Delivered **2019's #1 & #2 technologies for Unconventionals**, with combined estimated value of $24m: the Early Productivity Index Calculator (EPIC) and Production Optimisation & Surveillance Tool (POST). With these tools we productised scientific programming approaches for early assessment of well productivity, driven by new technology conceived by academia and industry research.
- **Conceived and delivered the [Brazil Advanced Data Analytics (BRADA) programme](https://web.yammer.com/main/threads/eyJfdHlwZSI6IlRocmVhZCIsImlkIjoiMTA5MjU3ODMzODk4ODAzMiJ9)** in areas such as reservoir engineering, wells integrity surveillance and contracts & procurement, with an estimated value of $100m+.
- **Leveraged the [collaboration between different teams](https://headlinesuk.foleon.com/shell-ai/shellai2019report/upstream-analytics/)** within Shell, such as asset teams, technology, development, IT and external research institutes.

_Bath, UK (Feb 2017 - Jun 2018)_

My research extends the risk-return relationship, from the portfolio optimisation theory, for energy demand aggregation based on **time-series forecasting and evolutionary optimisation**, collaborating with the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering to develop a smart-grid energy demand model.


__Production & Reservoir Engineer__ | Petrobras E&P Ultra-Deep Waters -
_Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Apr 2014 - Dec 2016)_

Performed reservoir engineering, production forecast and optimisation roles for Petrobras' pre-salt portfolio, collaborating with stakeholders such as project managers, executives and the regulatory agency.
- Delivered Lula's 2016 reserves estimation to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Brazilian regulatory agency, which takes into account **technology maturity, resources uncertainty, supply chain risks and economic evaluation**.
- Coordinated a team of three engineers **responsible for the resource optimisation of critical submarine equipment and vessels** for 15 FPSOs, negotiating the allocation proposal with the executive decision board.
- Created a decision support model for evaluating system impact of resource allocation changes, and liaised with project managers to deliver the optimal production output for the entire portfolio.


__Industrial Engineer__ | Petrobras Refining -
_Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Apr 2009 - Apr 2014)_

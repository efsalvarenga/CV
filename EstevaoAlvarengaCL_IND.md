Dear Madam/Sir,

**Ref: Industrial and Customer AI Mgr**

I would like to be part of the GM Data & AI Leadership Team in the afore mentioned role. I understand this role will fit both my career aspirations and the experiences I've built so far.

The Industrial and Customer AI Manager role has specific challenges where mature businesses are pressed to continue to deliver value while adopting lower carbon technologies such as electrification and hydrogen. In this role, I would focus on sharp efficiency for more traditional applications, leveraging existing architecture decision, or fostering new ones, where standardised approaches are preferred, strongly partnering with the broader IDT. Specifically for high innovative use cases, I would make sure business and operations context are taken into consideration in early solution design and implementation.

Having worked for 5 years in the Refining business, and focused 3 of my last 10 years in low carbon innovation, I believe I bring significant background on the subject matter of my stakeholders. In my career it’s been often required that I engage and influence the decisions of senior stakeholders, assurance teams, academia and vendors, while supporting negotiations and agreeing on techno-economic excellence. I trust those are skills that would benefit the team.

I am a hard-working, curious and creative engineer who always seeks analytical and result oriented solutions to problems. Throughout my career I have fostered collaborative relationships and was fortunate to assimilate valuable professional lessons. I understand the importance of providing high quality service to customers and correctly understanding their needs, while working efficiently. I also believe few of my achievements would be possible without close integration and extensive network with other disciplines in the industry.

Thank you for your time in considering this application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Estêvão Alvarenga CEng MIET

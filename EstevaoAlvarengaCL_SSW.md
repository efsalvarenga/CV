Dear Madam/Sir,

**Ref: SSW and Natural Sciences AI Mgr**

I would like to be part of the GM Data & AI Leadership Team in the afore mentioned role. I understand this role will fit both my career aspirations and the experiences I've built so far.

The SSW and Natural Sciences AI Manager role has specific challenges where the business aims at reducing internal development, without losing technical prowess. Focusing on customer value, application operations and maintainability is an important pathway to maintain technical skills in a cost effective way - competitive with external alternatives where applicable. I believe there is significant opportunity in systematising end-to-end AI & digital innovation in SSW and Natural Sciences, focused on requirements lifecycle. Having come from the SSW background, my existing experience and network can be leveraged to navigate stakeholders' organisations.

In the role, I would make sure to work closely with stakeholders to sharpen the existing portfolios, while empowering my team to leverage the architecture part of our VP-ship, aligning formal technology decisions and innovation flexibility. In my career it’s been often required that I engage and influence the decisions of senior stakeholders, assurance teams, academia and vendors, while supporting negotiations and agreeing on techno-economic excellence. I trust those are skills that would benefit the team.

I am a hard-working, curious and creative engineer who always seeks analytical and result oriented solutions to problems. Throughout my career I have fostered collaborative relationships and was fortunate to assimilate valuable professional lessons. I understand the importance of providing high quality service to customers and correctly understanding their needs, while working efficiently. I also believe few of my achievements would be possible without close integration and extensive network with other disciplines in the industry.

Thank you for your time in considering this application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Estêvão Alvarenga CEng MIET
